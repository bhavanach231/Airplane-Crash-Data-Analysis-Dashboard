# Airplane-Crash-Data-Analysis-Dashboard
**Objective:**
Developed a comprehensive Power BI dashboard to analyze historical airplane crash data, identifying key trends and deriving actionable insights to improve aviation safety.
**Data Collection & Preparation:**
Collected and cleaned data containing details of airplane crashes, including date, location, operator, aircraft type, and fatalities.
Ensured data consistency and corrected data types for accurate analysis.
Removed null values and geocoded locations for spatial analysis.
**Analysis & Metrics Development:**
Developed SQL queries to aggregate data and perform initial analysis.
Created DAX measures in Power BI to calculate Key Performance Indicators (KPIs).
Used DAX functions to create dynamic and interactive visuals.
**Tools and Technologies Used:**
Power BI: For creating interactive dashboards and visualizations.
SQL: For data aggregation and initial analysis.
DAX (Data Analysis Expressions): For creating dynamic measures and calculations in Power BI.
**Outcomes:**
Successfully developed an interactive Power BI dashboard with multiple pages, allowing stakeholders to explore data through intuitive visualizations and drill-down capabilities.
Enabled real-time monitoring and analysis of airplane crash trends, improving decision-making for aviation safety enhancements.
**Skills Gained:**
Proficiency in Power BI for data visualization and dashboard creation.
Advanced SQL and DAX skills for data analysis and KPI development.
Enhanced ability to clean and prepare large datasets for analytical purposes.
Strong understanding of aviation safety metrics and performance indicators.
**Overview**
This project demonstrates my ability to handle complex data analysis tasks, develop insightful metrics, and create user-friendly dashboards for effective data-driven decision-making.
